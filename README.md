# Task Tracker

This simple task tracker lets you add, edit, and delete tasks directly in your browser. The design uses a dark theme for a modern look.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage, so they will remain between sessions on the same device.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title and description
- Edit tasks inline
- Delete tasks you no longer need
- Data is stored locally in the browser
